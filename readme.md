# ghc 8.0.1 release

- ghc 8.0.1
- stack 1.10.0
- cabal 1.24.0.0

Note this repo is mostly a stub. Most work is here https://github.com/mitchty/alpine-linux-ghc-bootstrap

I try to keep things up to date, but this is all mostly a as I get time for it thing.

Note, I might ditch 7.10 in the nearish future, but for now use these generally:
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/7.10
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/8.0

Also note, there are 2 main repos I use to test with:
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/next/7.10
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/next/8.0

The latter two are there mostly for testing/validating things I'm building. They may break or be broken in general. There may be newer things in it, but they might not work. So caveat emptor.
