# ghc 8.0.1 release (20160313)

- ghc 8.0.1 at 2016-03-13
- stack 1.0.4
- cabal 1.24.0.0

Note this repo is mostly a stub. Most work is here https://github.com/mitchty/alpine-linux-ghc-bootstrap

I try to keep things up to date, but this is all mostly a as I get time for it thing.

Also note, there are ~3 repos I use to test with:
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/7.10
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/next/7.10
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/next/8.0

The latter two are there mostly for testing and validation. There may be newer things in either, but they might not work. So caveat emptor.
