# ghc 7.10.3 release

Contains:
- ghc 7.10.3
- stack 1.0.2
- cabal 1.22.9.0

Note this repo is mostly a stub. Most work is here https://github.com/mitchty/alpine-linux-ghc-bootstrap

I try to keep things up to date, but this is all mostly a as I get time for it thing.

Also note, there are 2 repos I use to test with:
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/7.10
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpine-ghc/next/7.10

The latter is there mostly for testing/validating things I'm building.

There may be newer things in it, but they might not work. So caveat emptor.
